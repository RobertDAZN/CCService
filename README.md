# CCService

For Coding Challenge Service

# Assumptions

- Service just tells if video can be streamed or not
  - Service does not store number of videos being streamed currently by the user

# Simplifying decissions:

- I have used (to some extent) serverless template provided at https://serverless-stack.com

# Installation

- Install NodeJS 8 (it is curently the highest version aws lambda supports)
- Install Serverless Framework per instructions at https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/
